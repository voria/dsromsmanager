DsRomsManager - 0.3
	* Do not pass gui elements to external functions.
	  Instead, pass the gui reference and use its specific
	  methods to update elements.
	* Fix random hangs on Ubuntu 9.04
	* Fix threads interactions (I hope)
	* Change URL for reviews
	* Resize games images to 50% and use a smaller game title
	  when screen vertical resolution is < 800
	* Big rewrite of application (mainly on database).
	  Now used RAM is greatly decreased, due to the fact that
	  the database on disk is used. In addition, DAT file is only
	  parsed once, when downloaded/updated. When it's parsed, a
	  new database is created and then used.
